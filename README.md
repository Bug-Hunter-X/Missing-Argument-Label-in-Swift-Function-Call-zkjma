# Missing Argument Label in Swift Function Call

This example demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include the external parameter name when calling a function.  Swift functions often use external parameter names to enhance readability.  If you define these, you must use them in the call.

The `bug.swift` file shows the error; `bugSolution.swift` provides the correction.
